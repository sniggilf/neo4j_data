Truly the giant Nimrod, ten cubits tall, whom Jonichus son of Noah begat, built Babylon and the tower, and Noah begat Jonichus after the Flood. Then seventy-two generations descended as follows: fifteen generations from Japhet, thirty from Ham, and twenty-seven from Shem, who, having dispersed, divided the whole world among themselves after the Flood. Shem reigned in Asia, Ham in Africa, Japhet in Europe. In Asia, there are sixteen countries, as follows: Ataxa, India, Sartia, Syria, Persia, Medea, Mesopotamia, Cappadocia, Palestine, Armenia, Cilicia, Egypt, Caldea, and Libya. In Africa, there are twelve countries, so named: Lydia, Smynia, Pentapolis, Ethiopia, Tolomaia, Lessentium, Jetall, Matalia, Numidia, Samartia, Siirdos Major, and Minor. In Europe, there are fifteen countries, as follows: Italy, Calabria, Spain, Almania, Macedonia, Tracedones, Dalmacia, Dannonia, Colonia, Germany, Gaul, Britain, Hibernia, and Septentrionalia. Therefore the generations of Japhet from whom six generations proceeded, are to be pursued and treated, for from the other two are the Jews and Gentiles. Japhet begat Jenan and Strephus, Jenan begat Cethis, Cethis begat Cyprus, Cyprus begat Cretus, Cretus begat Celius, who begat Saturn, who begat Jupiter, who begat Dardanus, and thus others.",23

He united with those he found and, having led Innogen daughter of Pandrasus into marriage and sailed over the Greek sea for two days and as many nights, he landed on the island of Leogecia, devastated by pirates. From there, having received a response from Diana [to his prayer], he took a journey and came to the place of the saltworks and the Altars of the Philistines, and turned his prows between Sicadem and the mountains of Agarie, and came to the borders of Illyria, where he joined with his own [people] a famous young man named Corineus, who drew his ancestry from Antenor and had been leader of that place. From there, accompanied by Corineus, Brutus entered Gaul, where the Gauls with their king were twice conquered, and founded a city of Trojans which, by the name of his friend Turnus who was killed there, he made to be called Tours. But after a delay of two years he entered the island [of] Albion in the third age of the world. While he was celebrating, Gogmagog, a detestable giant, arrived and was conquered with twenty similar giants. Brutus gave to Corineus part of the island now called Cornwall, thus called from the name of the leader. Truly Brutus named the island of Albion Britannia from his own name, and his companions Britons, and built a city in it which he named New Troy, that is now called London. With Brutus dead, his three sons divided the land amongst themselves. The portion between Cambria and the Severn fell to Locrinus, which he named Loygaria from his own name. To Cambrius fell the parts beyond the Severn and the sea which he named Cambria from his own name, now called Wales, so named for a certain leader, Wacle.

For when he had reigned for five years, on a certain day while hunting he met with his brother who had been deposed, who, having travelled all over many provinces, was still seeking help in order to be restored to his kingdom, and only found it now. Elidur, when he saw his brother, kissed him many times and, bringing him with him to the city of Dumbarton, concealed him in his own bedroom. Pretending that he was sick, the king sent messengers through the whole kingdom for the princes to meet with him. And when they had all assembled, the king ordered them to come through to him one at a time without noise, for he said that much conversation hurt his head, and ordered his ministers to seize those entering one at a time and cut off their heads unless they made his brother Arthgallo king again. And when they agreed he made a treaty with them. Elidur led Arthgallo with him to York and, taking the crown from his own head, put it on his [brother's] head, and for that reason he received this name [Pious] because of his aforementioned piety to his brother.",23

The king attacked Wales, founded Flint Castle from new and strengthened Rhuddlan Castle, where Llewelyn submitted to the king, having to give for his transgressions 50,000 pounds and for the island of Anglesea 1000 marks a year, but shortly afterwards the traitor David rose against the king and on Palm Sunday inflicted much evil against the English. Finally, King Edward, arriving around the feast of St John, subjugated Wales. The estates and lands which were in the middle of Wales he distributed to his nobles, but the coastal castles he kept for himself, from which act great tranquillity came to the Welsh in the time following. After this, around the feast of St Lucia, the head of Llewelyn was cut off and brought to the king in London. Soon afterwards David, his brother, was captured, the instigator of the whole misfortune, who was condemned in parliament at Shrewsbury, first torn apart by horses, secondly hanged, thirdly divided into quarters and distributed through the regions of England. Concerning Llewelyn a certain person wrote thus: 
""Here lies the tormentor of the English, defender of the Venedi 
Prince of the Welsh, Llewelyn, a model of customs 
The jewel of the Otteni, the flower of bygone kings 
The form of those to come, leader, glory, law, light of the people"" 
But truly another wrote thus: 
""Here lies the prince of errors and the pillager of men 
Traitor to the English, spiteful firebrand, sect of criminals, 
God of the Welsh, savage leader, murderer of the pious, 
Dregs of the Trojans, false to the roots, cause of evils, 
By St David, who composed verse well, 
By a thousand saints this Welshman was false."" 
In the second year of Edward I on the night of St Margaret a storm fell of rain, thunder and lightning, hardly heard of from past ages, striking and submerging crops, so that in London a peck of grain which previously was sold for three denarii, shortly after that increased to two solidi; thus for nearly 40 years until the death of King Edward this time of scarcity of grain continued, and thus several times in London a peck of corn was sold for 10 solidi. In this time the Jews were expelled from England and did not return. Also in the time of Edward I, a certain Madocus of the Welsh stirred up war in Wales. But the king, arriving around the feast of St Nicholas, captured the island of Anglesea, and there built a new city and castle of Beaumaris. At this time the forests in Wales were cut down, which [had] supplied the natives with hiding places in times of war, and [Edward] strengthened the castles around coastal places, and shortly afterwards Madocus was captured.

But in the time of his son Henry V, the Welsh began to live by the custom of the English – Polychronicon Book 1 Chapter 38 – they collect treasures; they fear losses of property; they develop gardens and fields; they gather themselves in towns; they ride clothed in mail; they walk with shoes; they comport themselves in a civilised manner; they sleep under coverings, so that they may be declared now more English than Welsh. Thus if a reason is sought why they live [this way] today, other than customary peace, the cause may be wealth; fear of loss restrains them. For one having nothing fears nothing. And so the satirist says: 'the wanting traveller sings in the presence of the robber, safer than the richer man adorned with ornaments.' This he [said].",17
